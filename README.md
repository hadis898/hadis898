Our generation is witnessing the erosion of the "free internet" space.

The Paradox of Internet Freedom
The gap between ideals and reality: The early internet was envisioned as a decentralized utopia, but today it has been reshaped by commercial monopolies (e.g., tech giants) and political interventions (e.g., state regulations). This shift stems partly from the need for cybersecurity, combating misinformation, and maintaining social stability, but it may also serve as an excuse for excessive control.
Case reflections: The EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) requires platforms to censor illegal content, aiming to protect users, but its vague provisions risk chilling free speech. The UK’s "online age verification" seeks to safeguard children but may sacrifice anonymity.
The Complexity of Global Regulatory Trends
No single narrative: Different countries pursue varying policy goals. For example:
China emphasizes "cyber sovereignty" and state control;
The EU champions strict privacy protections (e.g., GDPR) under the banner of "digital rights," while also mandating data localization;
The U.S. vacillates between free-market principles and content moderation.
The loss of technological neutrality: Encryption and anonymity tools (e.g., Tor), once seen as safeguards of freedom, are now often labeled as "threats" by governments.
A Zero-Sum Game Between Freedom and Security?
Lessons from counterterrorism and surveillance: Post-9/11 mass surveillance (e.g., the U.S. Patriot Act) demonstrated the dangers of sacrificing freedom in the name of security. Today, similar logic is applied to combat extremism, misinformation, and even social unrest.
The risk of techno-authoritarianism: Technologies like digital IDs and social credit systems, if unchecked, could evolve into 1984-style tools of surveillance.
Rethinking Intergenerational Responsibility
Is the accusation of "betraying the legacy" fair? Each generation faces unique challenges. The internet freedom of the past relied on technical barriers and state acquiescence, while today’s issues (e.g., AI misuse, deepfakes) demand new frameworks.
Rebuilding freedom in practice: Younger generations are not passive recipients. Open-source movements, cypherpunk culture, and decentralized networks (e.g., IPFS, Mastodon) are exploring alternatives.
Possibilities for Action
Technological resistance: Support end-to-end encryption (e.g., Signal), anonymity networks, and anti-censorship tools like blockchain.
Policy engagement: Advocate for laws that define surveillance boundaries (e.g., digitizing the U.S. Fourth Amendment) and oppose vague definitions of "harmful content."
Public discourse: Resist reducing complex issues to a binary "freedom vs. security" debate, and strive to balance rights and responsibilities.
Conclusion: Freedom Needs Redefining
Internet freedom was never absolute, but its contraction reminds us that rights must be actively defended, not passively inherited. History will not simplistically judge any generation for "betraying freedom," but it will record which acts of resistance emerged at critical moments. Rather than succumbing to despair, we must channel our anxieties into engagement with the ethics of technology, legal frameworks, and social contracts—for the true dystopia begins when people stop believing change is possible.
